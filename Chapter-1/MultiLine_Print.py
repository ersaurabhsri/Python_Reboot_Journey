    Hey folks!
    I’m restarting my journey with Python from scratch after a break, 
    and I’ve decided to document everything in this public repository.
    This space will serve as my learning journal — filled with core concepts, hands-on exercises, notes, 
    and mini-projects as I rebuild my foundation.
    By keeping it open, I hope to stay consistent, track my progress, 
    and possibly help others who are also learning or revisiting Python.
    Whether you're a complete beginner or just refreshing your skills, feel free to explore, fork, or contribute!
