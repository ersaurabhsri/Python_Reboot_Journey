# 🚀 Relearning Python from Scratch

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my journey of **relearning Python from the ground up**. Whether you're just starting out or revisiting the basics like me, you're more than welcome to follow along, share thoughts, or even contribute.

## 📌 Why This Repo?

After some time away from hands-on Python practice, I decided to go back to the basics—this time with more structure, consistency, and focus. My goal is to:

* Reinforce the **fundamentals**
* Practice with **simple but meaningful exercises**
* Build **mini-projects** that apply what I’ve learned
* Stay accountable and document progress publicly

If you're on a similar path, I hope this repo gives you some ideas, support, or even motivation.
